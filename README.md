# compiler_proj
Project done for Compiler in ShanghaiTech, which is also the project in Stanford.

## PA1

A lexer written for COOL. Flex used.

There are potential bugs, see README inside.

## PA2

A parser written for COOL. [bison](http://gnu.org/software/bison) used. 

Do notice that PA2 is a little bit different from that in Stanford.

My _cool.y_ couldn't correctly print all the error log, but the parser functions as long as the program is correct.
