# PA4: cool semantic analysis

This folder originates from Stanford CS143. Missing folders and files(mainly binary, which is not suitable for git) can be retrived from their [couse page](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs143/).(Or [ShanghaiTech](http://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/songfu/course/spring2018/CS131/)'s CS131 should the course page work by the time you see this.)

## src


## test


## scripts

## cool-support

cool-support is provided by CS143, yet it contains some important files that you should really read and understand.
